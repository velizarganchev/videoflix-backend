"""
content_app.signals â€” Video model signal handlers for Videoflix

Purpose:
--------
- On create: enqueue background conversions to multiple resolutions.
- On delete: enqueue removal of the source file and all derived renditions.
- On update (video_file changed): enqueue cleanup of old source and renditions.

Notes:
- Uses django-rq to offload heavy work (transcode / delete) to background workers.
- All storage paths refer to the storage key (S3 key or FileSystem key), not local paths.
