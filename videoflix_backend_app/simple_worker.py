"""
Custom RQ Worker (non-forking version).

This module overrides the default RQ worker behavior for controlled
job execution inside the same process/thread — useful for:
- Testing environments (no fork(), easier debugging)
- Dockerized setups where forking causes permission or resource issues
- Environments where multiprocessing is restricted (e.g., some shared hosts)

Key points:
- `BaseDeathPenalty`: dummy context manager replacing RQ’s timeout killer.
- `SimpleWorker`: subclass of RQ’s SimpleWorker that disables forking.

Usage:
--------
This worker is typically referenced by Django RQ configuration
(e.g., `RQ_QUEUES`) or used manually in testing.
